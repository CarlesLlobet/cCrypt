# cCrypt
Own implementation of an different cryptography engines in Python, and certain attacks.

This project aims to implement an AES and DES engines unmasked and masked in Python to analyze its behaviour, and better understand its functioning.

It also has grown to implement the RSA and two attacks to criptographic implementations: Differential Fault Analysis and Correlation Computational Analysis
